                    Having read about this trail, I was excited to be following the San Tiago trail. We headed south, over the bleak but dramatically stunning mountain range on 
                    the border of <a href="spain.html">Spain</a> and Portugal. We stuck to the main motorway to get there and as we came across the big viaduct leading into the north
                    of Portugal, I saw the sign and it felt like being home... I love Portugal!

                    Our first night was getting close and we had to find a place for the evening. There were a lot of mountain tracks but mostly private or not suitable for sleeping.
                    As we drove through the mountains, we enjoyed the views of the national park and the river we followed, with lakes indispursed. We eventually came to a junction
                    in the roads where I could see a dirt track running alongside the riverbank not far from a watersports club. We followed it, another bumpy dirt track, but these
                    seem to always be the ones to lead to great locations. This one didn't dissapoint either. We found a flat spot at the bottom of a hill nestled in the trees
                    and right on the waters edge, with a traditional Douro fishing boat tied to the trees. We settled in for the evening, took a walk along the bank then set about dinner
                    under the tailgate. The location and view was spectacular. As we ate, we watched the sun go down behind the hill on the oposite bank of the river as another fishing boat
                    went by. And such a peaceful night!
                </p>
                <h3 class="heading">31st July - Over the Mountains and Through Devastated Forest</h3>
                <p class="blog">
                    We woke up and slid the door open to the river view and the fishing boat bobbing around. After coffee and a hearty breakfast we packed ourselves up,
                    cleared some of the rubbish and mess left by others (Always leave a place cleaner than you found it folks! <a href="https://twitter.com/leavenotrace" target="blank">#leavenotrace</a>)
                    We drove higher into the mountains stopping at the highest city in Portugal, Guarda, at an altitude of 1,056 metres. We moved on from there over the mountain
                    range with our next stop being the highest mountain in Portugal, Serra Da Estrela (translated, Star Mountain). After climbing the windy roads to the top, we started
                    our decent and stopped in a typically indiginous mountin village with the stone cobbled streets, small squares with fountains and blue tile covered buildings, and a view down the mountain for miles.
                    We had to stop for coffee and pastries! Once we had got our sustainance, we drove on, making our way down through what seemed like the most rural part of the country, down country roads past farms and villages
                    and then we reached the devastation. The year before there had been some terrible forst fires in this part of the country, and it was a huge part too. We drove for 30 miles and still we
                    saw burnt trees and scorched houses. It was only on the outskirts of Coimbra, a large university town in the north of the country, that we were back in greenery. A very sobering drive.

                <h3 class="heading">31st July - 2nd August - From City To Coast</h3>
                <p class="blog">
                    Once in Coimbra we stopped to tour the city. We have always loved this country and its capital, Lisbon. It has to be said that Portuguese cities have to be some
                    of the most charming and ornate in Europe, with pretty and ornate squares, churches with tiled exteriors and the rustic look of the houses by the side of shiny stone cobbled streets.
                    Coimbra was no exception and we took in the charm as we walked around before getting on the road again to reach the coast. Once at the coast we found Figueira Da Foz, a busy port town
                    on the estuary of the Mondego river. We passed through and hit the coast road. As we drove through more forestry over a hill, we came to our next stop, the town of Quiaios set int he forestry,
                    on the edge of the Atlantic ocean. We found a forest camp site and set up camp for the next two nights. After a few days it was good to have the fecilities of the camp.
                    Quiaios was spectacular, from the wild coast and huge waves smashing on to the sandy beaches, to the boardwalks along the town beachfront and restaurants on them. Being quite remote,
                    it was the perfect place to recouperate and catch our breath.

                <p class="blog">
                    After two nights it was time to move on. We were set on driving along the coast. Little did we realise the windy, bumpy roads that awaited us. We drove through forestry, over dirt tracks,
                    visiting lots of stunning beaches on our journey north. This is known as the Silver Coast and it was clear to see why, with the silver white soft sand on every beach we came to.
                    We were headed to Porto, where we found another campsite just up from the beach in Gaia, a suburb of the city. Here we made some friends with some dutch lads travelling around Europe, and 
                    sampled some local cuisine made by some neighbours in a caravan, a couple from just down the coast. We loved our time here. From the beaches of Gaia where we rested and swam, to 
                    the Port houses alongside the Douro river, looking across to the old city, to the markets, the cable cars, the street art, the old iron bridge, the monestary, the cathedral at the top of the city,
                    the narrow alleyways down the mountain inside the city, the buildings with their rustic charm and the many church buildings covered in azuleijos, the blue tiles the country is famous for.
                    Everywhere you turned was history and charm, and of course a great photo oportunity! I may have said, we love Portugal!
