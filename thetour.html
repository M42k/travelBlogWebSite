                <h3>19th July - Alpe D'Huez Baby! - Start of an Epic Trip</h3>
                <img src="IMAGES/pics/THETOUR1.jpg" alt="Alpe D'Huez" class="trip-pictures-right" />
                <p>
                    This was to be the start of our Europe trip. An epic two weeks following The Tour De France, something we had always wanted to do.
                    We arrived the day before our first stage to see Geraint Thomas take his first Yellow Jersey, and take it on the Alpe D'Huez! This was a great start to our journey.
                    As we arrived we drove up the switchbacks, hoping to find a place to stop. We had been told
                    that people arrive well in advance to get the good spots and it was true, everywhere was full, cars and vans hanging precariously on
                    the side of the mountain. We continued to the top as if we couldn't find a spot, it would have been good to climb the switchbacks and see the finish.
                    It turned out, we found a spot right near the finish, along with a lot of other vans and cars in a car park near the piste restaurants with a view over the mountains. Result!
                </p>
                <h3>20th July - Alpine Forest and Team Sky</h3>
                <p>
                    Having driven down from Alpe D'Huez the night before in a convoy of cars, vans and motor homes all moving on to the next stage, we drove down the windy
                    roads enjoying the views below. Near to Bourg D'Oisans we found ourselves a gorgeous alpine woodland and river where we stopped for the night, and swam in the river the next day.
                </p>
                <img src="IMAGES/pics/THETOUR2.jpg" alt="Sir Dave" class="trip-pictures-right" />
                <p>
                    A short walk from our camp spot was the village that the day's stage was leaving from and we found a spot by the side of the road to watch the spectacle.
                    We enjoyed the usual procession of tour buses and cars as they rolled in to the village. As I took a walk into the village along the main road, I stumbled across
                    the 'paddock' where all the team buses had stopped and the bikes and cars were lined up prepared. Towards the end we found Team Sky preparing for the day and watched
                    as the riders came out and got on their bikes to register. Even Sir Dave Brailsford was out talking to us.
                    Once back at our spot we took our position waiting for the riders to come through. First though was the caravan spectacle. Lots of floats from the sponsors in a carnival
                    fashion throwing out free things for the crowd. Then the riders. Geraint Thomas leading the way, the first day in the Malliot Jaune. Once everyone had passed, it was back to the river for a swim.
