                    2018 was a big year for change. We bought the Nissan Elgrand in January with the intention of it being a daily use vehicle and a camper, our holiday home.
                    We knew we wanted a different setup from normal. We wanted a comfy bed and somewhere to cook out the back of the Elgrand under the tailgate. We set about drawing plans up. 
                    We built out a very rough first iteration of the layout.

                    We travelled to <a href="cornwall.html">Cornwall</a> over Easter holidays to test this out. That is a story for another blog. Meanwhile, we worked through March 
                    to create a bed platform of plywood on battens that folded out on hinges to make the full six foot bed, with a slide out 'drawer' platform for cooking on. 
                    We had a folding bowl as our sink with a pump preassure shower as our water 8 litre water supply with tap. The cooker was a little single burner gas canister portable stove.

                <p>
                    This worked well as a layout, although we had a few changes we wanted to make. The whole process needed to be smoother and we needed better storage. This led to iteration two of the build.
                    We installed sliding drawers for the work surface and cooker. Still though with a rudementary platform and battens. Althought the fold out mattresses were soft, this still wasn't 
                    the nost comfy, so we started looking at other options.

                <p>
                    This iteration was tested over the bank holiday in May 2018, but we knew we needed something better for that summer. We were to live in the van for 5 weeks.
                    The decision was made to fabricate a pull out drawer from the rear and use the workings from a Somme Toile sofa bed, bought second hand on Gumtree, 
                    to make our bed / kitchen pod. And so iteration 3 came about. This was the one to take us through Europe. All for a relatively low cost, we had a comfy bed, 
                    kitchen / work surface, preassure shower / tap and bowl / sink. We were set... nearly. A few adjustments were needed. Some storage, the electrics 
                    consisting of a solar panel for charging our AGM leisure battery and some LED lights, map decopage and varnish along with edging for all the panels 
                    to finish them off. We were nearly there. We added the fridge, a cooler box wired into the leisure battery system, and an inverter so we could use 
                    240v if needed (we never have). We were set. Self sufficient for some wild camping. Europe here we come!

                    First we had to test it out though. Where better than Oxwich bay? We packed the van for a barbque, parked overlooking the beach. This is one of our favourite places.
                    The new unit performed brilliantly. We were set for Europe. A couple of tweeks just made it a little better and, just in time, we were ready. All in all we had a 
                    camper conversion for not very much money and a little labour of love.
