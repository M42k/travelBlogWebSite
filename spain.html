                    Leaving the Tour De France behind, we headed south. We climbed the Pyrenees some more and found the Bielsa tunnel, a 3km tunnel running through the mountain downhill. The views over the valleys
                    from the mountain road were spectacular, and the mountain villages beautiful. At the tunnel we had to wait. It was controlled through traffic lights allowing
                    travel in one direction. We took advantage of the wait and stopped for a stretch and to take in the mountain views. As we emerged the other side, it was amazing the change in landscape.
                    It seemed we had driven into a canyon in the wild west with dramtic crags and rock formations. We followed the road down the mountain, passing through a few small villages and 
                    the bluest water reservoir we had ever seen, fed from white water rivers through the rocky landscape. We followed the windy roads past rivers, reservoirs and rocky tunnels until the evening was drawing in.
                    Having been wild camping for the last week, and being our first night in Spain, we decided to use a campsite so we could shower and do laundry. We found Benabarre. A small hillside
                    town with a medievel castle and a campsite by the side. This was perfect. It had all the amenities we needed so we booked ourselves in.

                <h3 class="heading">29th July - Zaragoza and The Black Lagoon</h3>
                <p class="blog">
                    After a restful night we set off for a day that would prove to be mostly driving. We were heading south west to <a href="portugal.html">Portugal</a>. Spain is a big country though, and we had one more night
                    there on the way down. We drove south for a while and turned west along long, straight roads over mountain planes with run down and derelict motels and hotels by the side of them
                    and no towns or villages for miles and miles. Eventually we came to the surroundings of a city. We had come to Zaragoza, the capital of the northeastern Aragon region.
                    Here we picked a spot by the Ebro river overlooking the basilica and the oldest bridge in the city for our lunch. It was a hot day and evidently wedding day as two of the wedding parties came to the edge
                    of the river for their photos as we looked on. After lunch and a walk by the river we were back on the road heading west. We had found a spot to reach for the night, a reservoir
                    just past the mountain town, Soria, called Lagoa Negra, meaning the Black Lagoon. Passing through Soria, we enjoyed the charm of the town with its old buildings and parks.
                    The reservoir was a beautiful spot that we decided to spend a couple of nights at. The little beaches led into the lake and rock structures in between the bays added a bit of drama
                    while the forest around the edge gave some good cover and shade from the sun. It was perfect. We set up camp by a little inlet and enjoyed the sunset over the lake as we had 
                    a very spanish dinner, and one of the most quiet sleeps we had had on our trip.

                <h3 class="heading">8th - 10th August - Roman hot springs in Galicia</h3>
                <p class="blog">
                    We passed through Spain twice, both on the way down and coming back north. I had found a spot that was perfect for a few nights stay. Just about 20 minutes from the 
                    Portuguese border, not far from the city of Orense, was a lake with ruins of a Roman house on its banks. Within this lake, as in the river that feeds it, are three hot springs.
                    These were utilised by the Romans to create roman baths for the house and the baths and springs still remain to this day. We found the path hidden just off the main mountain road
                    and drove down the narrow bumpy dirt track to be welcomed by a stunning lake with a carpark in the woods. Along the grassy banks were tents of travellers enjoying the lake
                    and in the carpark were three or four other vans opening out onto the lake. The weather was hot and there were people all round the banks and using the hot tub. We were set
                    for a few nights and all completely free. We enjoyed our time there, taking advantage of the warm baths and cool lake morning and evening and exploring the roman ruins.
                    It was so relaxing, and there was no better feeling than being sat in the hot springs with a cup of coffee in the morning enjoying the sunrise and in the evening with a beer
                    or a glass of wine enjoying the bright dome of stars above our heads as we met and chatted to travellers of all nationalities from Isreal to Germany. Could life get any better than this?

                <h3 class="heading">11th August - Bay of Biscay</h3>
                <p class="blog">
                    It was hard to tear ourselves away from the gorgeous lake and hotsprings. However we had a treck ahead of us up through Galicia, over the planes again and then over the peaks of the Pyrenees
                    and down to the Bay of Biscay. This was our last night in Spain and we couldn't have picked a better spot. We found a it on the cliff next to a number of other vans for the
                    eveing, overlooking a stunning sandy beach one way and in the shadow of the dramatic peaks of the Pyrenees mountains the other, the coast known as the jurassic coast.
                    The weather was warm, the sea was warm and we walked the beach enjoying another gorgeous sunset and paddling in the warm water. The next morning we were up and before breakfast,
                    but after coffee of course, we took a swim. It was a lovely refreshing swim in the warm waters of the Bay of Biscay, diving through the waves. It set us up for the day driving
                    back up to <a href="france.html">France</a>.
